## Security

// List security concerns:
// - that have been addressed
// - that have _not_ been addressed

## Improvements

// What could be added to the app / API?

## Libraries

// What external libraries have you used and why?

### debounce-promise

Used to debounce the search handler to prevent hammering the API and potentially showing results which are inconsistent with the search term.

## API

// Any general observation about the API?
// document each endpoint using the following template:

```


### GET /resources
// Description of the endpoint:
// - what does the endpoint do?
// - what does it return?
// - does it accept specific parameters?
```
